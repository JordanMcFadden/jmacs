* all about preference
----------------------
>> just like in vanilla html & css you can either put styles into one
   stylesheet or multiple. I will probably end up making component
   folders & style folders.


* style components
------------------
>> Dave speaks about style components being a good option for using css in
   react but he does not go into detail, might check it out later.


* in-line styling normal
------------------------
>> Can apply css inside of element just like in vanilla html & css but
   instead of it being like a attribute it is like an object.
   
#+begin_src js
        <header style={{
            backgroundColor: 'mediumblue',
            color: '#fff'
        }}>
#+end_src


* in-line styling variables
---------------------------
>> Can apply css inside of element by using variable names instead of
   raw css.

#+begin_src js
  // outside return & inside return 
	  const headerStyle = {
	      backgroundColor: 'royalblue',
	      color: '#fff
	  };

	  <header style={headerStyle}>
#+end_src


* linking to stylesheet
-----------------------
>> As said previously css can also be applied to each component seperately
   then imported or there can be one file that targets components & elements
   alike.
