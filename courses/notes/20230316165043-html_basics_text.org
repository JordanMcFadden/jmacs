* body tag content
------------------
>> the body tag content houses all of the information that appears on the
   actualy document(what client sees). 


* header hiearchy
-----------------
>> remember to keep a consistent header hiearchy. it helps the browser &
   screen readers navigate a html document. it also helps a developer
   keep a html document organized. there should only be one main header
   and you really don't want more than 3 levels of headings.


* block elements
----------------
>> block elements are elements that take up an entire line of an html
   document. here are some examples of block elements.

#+begin_src html
  <h1>       main heading
  <h2>       sub heading
   .
   .
   .
  <h6>       heading go to like 6 levels
  <p>        paragraphs or text blocks
  <br>       line break
  <address>  addresses
  <hr>       horizontal rule
#+end_src


* inline elements
-----------------
>> inline elements are elements that only take up the amount of space
   allocated to them. here are some examples.

  <strong>                      bold
