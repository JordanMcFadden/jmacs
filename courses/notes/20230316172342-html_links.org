* link guidelines
-----------------
1. avoid printing the full web address
2. avoid saying "this links to"
3. do not use "click here" (it provides no meaning)
4. keep link text short

* absolute reference
--------------------
>> an absolute reference is one that has https: and .com or
   something around that. here is an example
   https://www.notion.so/HTML-5677fe5e0fb348ff9833d06641679fee

* types of links
----------------
>> there are absolute references to websites online but you
   can also link to files on your computer as well as sections
   of an html page. here are some examples

#+begin_src html
  <a href="link">             regular link
  <a href="#section-id">      links to this id on a page
  <a href="#">                links to the top of page
  <a href="/">                links to home/root page
  <a href="tel:">             links to a number
  <a href="mailto:">          links to a email
    
  <a href="imgpath" download>      downloads the image at path
  <a href="path" target="_blank">  opens in a new tab
