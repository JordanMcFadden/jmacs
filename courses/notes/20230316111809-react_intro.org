* getting started
-----------------
>> need node & create-react-app, to start run npm start in root project directory


* public folder
---------------
>> won't really work in public folder, index is the only important file and it is only
   important when we need to add fonts or things of that nature.


* git
-----
>> there is a git ignore file but not a git folder like in the course, I don't know why
   but I will figure it out. git ignore looks fine.

   
* index
-------
>> only one index.html file and the rest is rendered using react.


* don't needs
-------------
>> for the course we don't need reportWebVitals.js, setupTests, App.test.js


* package.json
--------------
>> holds dependencies & scripts


* readme
--------
>> gonna change this to an org file


* app
------
>> app component is the parent component
