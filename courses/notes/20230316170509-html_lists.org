* lists & items
-------
>> there are four different types of lists in html, this page will only show
   three out of the four because one is only used in forms. lists are
   helpful for a variety of reason but mostly for navigation items. list
   items are used for both ordered & unordered lists.
   
#+begin_src html
<li> list item
#+end_src


* ordered lists
---------------
>> ordered lists are just numbered lists, can be reordered and things of
   that nature using css. (1. 2. 3.)

#+begin_src html
  <ol>
    <li></li>
  </ol>
#+end_src
   

* unordered lists
-----------------
>> unordered lists are just bulleted lists can be changed using css aswell.

#+begin_src html
  <ul>
    <li></li>    
  </ul>
#+end_src


* description lists
-------------------
>> consists of a description term & details. like for example you want
   to make a list of places you wan't to visit and then why. this is
   where a description list would be your best option.

#+begin_src html
<dl>
  <dt>The North Pole</dt>
  <dd>I hear it is <strong>cold</strong>!</dd>

  <dt>The South Pole</dt>
  <dd>Heard here is also cold.</dd>

 <dt>Antarctica</dt>
 <dd>Obviously it is cold here!</dd>
</dl
#+end_src
